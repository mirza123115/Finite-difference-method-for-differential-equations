Solution of differential equation using MATLAB code description 1. r = linspace(5, 8, 100): It generates a linearly spaced vector ‘r’ with 100 elements ranging from 5 to 8. 2. dr = r(2) – r(1): This calculates the spacing between adjacent elements of ‘r’. 3. a = eye(100, 100): It initializes a 100x100 identity matrix ‘a’.
